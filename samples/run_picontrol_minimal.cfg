# In this run Im using the E3SM data thats been published to ESGF on the Livermore node
# since the data is all available locally, the transfer_type has been set to local, and the
# local_path option in the data_types section has been changed to reflect the storage location

# this is a minimal config that just runs a couple small jobs.
